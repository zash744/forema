        <p>Hey princess!! Im gonna make this page a little bit snoopy themed. I asked you to be my valentine in a snoopy them so its only right! </p>
        <p>The context of this picture are you holding 2 sets of flowers. One for you and one for my mom. The red tulips were so damn bright and I'm so 
            happy you ended up liking it!
        </p>
        <p>Before getting into this day, lets just admire how beautiful you are mashallah. Literally so gorgeous. 
            This day was really special. It was both ours first actual Valentines Day! We had a lot of fun. I believe we first went to 
            Pizza Hut and got our pizza and went to Columbia Mall and watched Gordon Ramsay in your car. The pizza was so good and i was so fat.
            I remember we went to the mall after and hung out a little bit and we both went to MAIN EVENT together!!!!! It was so fun!! I loved playing the connect 4 
            basketball game with you!! And then after we went to THE CHEESECAKE FACTORYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
            I remember we could barely finish anything LMAOO. We got the dip and pasta, but we could barely finish the pasta bc the dip filled us up.
        </p>
        <p>I can whole heartedly say that this was one of the best days of my life and I'm so happy it was with you. </p>
